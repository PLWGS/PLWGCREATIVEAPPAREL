## 1. Project Overview

This document provides a comprehensive review of the PLWGCREATIVEAPPAREL e-commerce project. It synthesizes information from all existing project documentation and combines it with direct code analysis and functional testing to create a single, up-to-date source of truth.

The goal of this project is to create a fully functional, database-driven e-commerce website for custom apparel, featuring a customer-facing storefront and a comprehensive admin dashboard for business management.

### Technology Stack

-   **Backend:** Node.js with Express
-   **Database:** PostgreSQL
-   **Frontend:** HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript
-   **Image Management:** Cloudinary
-   **Authentication:** JWT-based with bcrypt password hashing
-   **Email:** Nodemailer for SMTP email
-   **Deployment:** Railway
-   **Input Validation:** express-validator
-   **Testing:** Comprehensive test suite

## 2. Architecture

### Backend (`server.js`)

The backend is a monolithic Node.js application built with Express. It handles:
-   API endpoints for all application features with comprehensive input validation
-   Database interaction with a PostgreSQL database
-   User authentication (admin and customer) with 2FA support
-   Image uploads to Cloudinary
-   Email notifications via Nodemailer
-   Size-based pricing system for products
-   **Custom input system with full data persistence from cart to orders**
-   **🎯 Custom question fields for personalized customer requests**
-   **📧 Automatic email notifications for orders with custom inputs**
-   **Dynamic shipping cost system with customer choice between standard shipping and local pickup**

### Database (PostgreSQL)

The application uses a PostgreSQL database with a comprehensive schema to store all data, including:
-   Products with size-based pricing (JSONB column)
-   **Products with size chart data (chest width, length measurements with garment type presets)**
-   **Products with custom input configuration (birthday and lyrics customization)**
-   **Products with custom question fields (optional questions per product)**
-   **Products with dynamic shipping costs and local pickup options**
-   Customers
-   Orders
-   **Order items with custom input data (JSONB column)**
-   **Orders with detailed shipping amount tracking (subtotal, shipping_amount, tax_amount, discount_amount)**
-   Shopping Carts
-   **Cart items with custom input data (JSONB column)**
-   Custom Requests
-   Subscribers
-   Wishlists
-   And more.

The `server.js` file includes logic to initialize the database with the required tables if they don't already exist.

### Frontend (`pages/`)

The frontend consists of a collection of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. The pages are served statically by the Express server. The frontend interacts with the backend via a set of RESTful APIs and includes:
-   Enhanced UI/UX with loading states and skeleton screens
-   Toast notifications and error handling
-   Real-time form validation
-   Responsive design improvements
-   Size-based pricing display with dynamic updates
-   **Professional custom input forms for customer customization requests**
-   **🎯 Custom question fields with highlighted styling and clear labeling**
-   **📧 Automatic email notifications sent to admin for custom orders**
-   **👁️ Enhanced admin dashboard with readable custom input display**

## 2.5 Size Chart System

- **Data Format**:
  ```json
  {
    "garmentType": "adult-tshirt",
    "sizes": {
      "S": {"chest": "18", "length": "28"},
      "M": {"chest": "20", "length": "29"},

      "XL": {"chest": "24", "length": "31"},
      "2XL": {"chest": "26", "length": "32"}
    }
  }
  ```
- **Admin Interface**: Available in `admin-uploads.html` for new products and `product-edit.html` for existing products
- **Customer Display**: Automatic rendering in product detail pages with professional table formatting

### Integration Points
- **admin-uploads.html**: Size chart section for new product creation
- **product-edit.html**: Size chart editing for existing products
- **product.html**: Size chart display in customer-facing product pages
