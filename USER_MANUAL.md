### Adding New Products - Complete Step-by-Step Guide

#### Step 1: Access the Admin Dashboard
1. **Navigate to Admin Panel**: 
   - Open your web browser and go to your website URL
   - Add `/pages/admin.html` to the end of your domain
   - Example: `https://yourdomain.com/pages/admin.html`
   - **Note**: The admin panel is only accessible to authorized administrators

2. **Login Authentication**:

   - Click the "Login" button
   - **Security Note**: Keep your admin credentials secure and never share them

3. **Dashboard Navigation**:
   - Once logged in, you'll see the main admin dashboard
   - Look for the navigation menu (usually on the left side or top of the page)
   - Click on **"Product Management"** or **"Products"** section

#### Step 2: Select Add New Product Tab
1. **Tab Selection**:
   - In the Product Management section, you'll see two main tabs:
     - **"Add New Product"** (this is what you want)
     - **"Edit Existing Products"**
   - Click on the **"Add New Product"** tab
   - The active tab will be highlighted (typically in teal color)

#### Step 3: Fill in Product Details - Left Column

##### Product Name (Required Field)
- **Purpose**: This is the primary title that customers will see on your shop page and product detail pages
- **Action**: Click in the text field labeled "Enter product name"
- **Best Practices**:
  - Use descriptive, SEO-friendly names
  - Include key design elements (e.g., "Vintage Skull T-Shirt", "Abstract Art Hoodie")
  - Keep it concise but informative
  - Avoid generic names like "T-Shirt" or "Hoodie"

##### Price ($) (Required Field)
- **Purpose**: This is the **actual selling price** that customers will pay for your product
- **Action**: Click in the text field and enter the base price
- **Important Pricing Information**:
  - **Standard Sizes (S, M, L, XL)**: Use the base price you enter here
  - **2XL Size**: Automatically adds a $2.00 markup to this base price
  - **Example**: If you enter $20.00 as the base price:
    - S, M, L, XL sizes = $20.00 each
    - 2XL size = $24.00 ($20.00 + $4.00 markup)
- **Format**: Enter as a number with up to 2 decimal places (e.g., 20.00, 45.99)

  - Halloween, Christmas, Summer Collection
- **Best Practice**: Select the most specific category that accurately describes your product

##### Original Price ($)
- **Purpose**: This field is used to create **discount displays** for customers
- **How It Works**:
  - **Price ($)**: The actual selling price (what customers pay)
  - **Original Price ($)**: A higher price that shows what the item "used to cost"
  - **Automatic Discount Calculation**: The system automatically calculates and displays the discount percentage
- **Example Scenarios**:
  - **No Discount**: Leave blank or enter the same value as Price ($)
  - **25% Off**: Price ($) = $30.00, Original Price ($) = $40.00
  - **50% Off**: Price ($) = $25.00, Original Price ($) = $50.00
  - **Clearance Sale**: Price ($) = $15.00, Original Price ($) = $60.00
