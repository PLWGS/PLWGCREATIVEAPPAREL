# CRITICAL WEBHOOK HANDOVER - PAYPAL PAYMENT CONFIRMATION EMAILS

## ‚úÖ ISSUE RESOLVED - WEBHOOK WORKING!
**PayPal webhooks are NOW working perfectly! Email confirmations are being sent successfully.**

## üìã CURRENT STATUS - ALL WORKING!
- ‚úÖ **Payments are working**: Customers can complete purchases successfully
- ‚úÖ **Webhook is configured**: PayPal webhook is properly set up in PayPal dashboard
- ‚úÖ **Server is stable**: No more crashes after JSON error handling fixes
- ‚úÖ **Webhook reception**: Server is receiving webhook calls successfully
- ‚úÖ **Order lookup**: Fixed to use proper PayPal Order ID lookup
- ‚úÖ **Emails are sending**: Confirmation emails are being sent to customers and admin
- ‚úÖ **Order status updating**: Orders are being updated to "completed" status

## üîç PROBLEM ANALYSIS

### What We Know Works:
1. **PayPal Integration**: Payments process successfully through PayPal
2. **Order Creation**: Orders are created in database with correct payment IDs
3. **Email System**: Resend API is configured and working (tested successfully)
4. **Webhook Endpoint**: `/api/paypal/webhook` endpoint exists and has extensive debugging

### What's NOT Working:
1. **Email Notifications**: No payment confirmation emails are being sent
2. **Order Status Updates**: Orders remain in "pending" status instead of "completed"
3. **Webhook Processing**: Webhooks are received but order processing may be failing

## üõ†Ô∏è TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Webhook Configuration:
- **URL**: `https://plwgscreativeapparel.com/api/paypal/webhook`
- **Events**: `PAYMENT.CAPTURE.COMPLETED`, `PAYMENT.CAPTURE.DENIED`, `PAYMENT.CAPTURE.REFUNDED`
- **Environment**: PayPal Sandbox
- **Webhook ID**: Configured in environment variables

### Server Configuration:
- **Platform**: Railway
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Email**: Resend API (working)
- **PayPal SDK**: @paypal/checkout-server-sdk

### Database Schema (Orders Table):
```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  order_number VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  customer_id INTEGER REFERENCES customers(id),
  customer_email VARCHAR(255),
  customer_name VARCHAR(255),
  total_amount NUMERIC(10,2) NOT NULL,
  status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'pending',
  shipping_address TEXT,
  tracking_number VARCHAR(100),
  notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  subtotal NUMERIC(10,2),
  shipping_amount NUMERIC(10,2) DEFAULT 0.00,
  tax_amount NUMERIC(10,2) DEFAULT 0.00,
  discount_amount NUMERIC(10,2) DEFAULT 0.00,

```

**Key Fields:**

- `order_number`: Human-readable order number (e.g., "PLW-2025-6068")
- `payment_status`: Order payment status ("pending", "completed", "denied", "refunded")
- `payment_details`: JSONB field storing PayPal webhook data

**Current Database Data (Recent Orders):**
```
 id |    payment_id     | order_number  |         created_at
----+-------------------+---------------+----------------------------

**Database Connection:**
- **URL**: `postgresql://postgres:VUnnjQcJRFyEWKlrJbCiWsshrEpYkUbp@trolley.proxy.rlwy.net:19611/railway`
- **PSQL Command**: `bin\psql.exe postgresql://postgres:VUnnjQcJRFyEWKlrJbCiWsshrEpYkUbp@trolley.proxy.rlwy.net:19611/railway`

### Key Files Modified:
1. **`server.js`**: 
   - PayPal webhook endpoint at line 5498
   - Email functions using Resend API
   - Extensive debugging logs added
   - JSON error handling improved

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID`: Sandbox client ID
   - `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET`: Sandbox secret
   - `PAYPAL_ENVIRONMENT`: sandbox
   - `PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID`: Webhook ID from PayPal
   - `RESEND_API_KEY`: Working Resend API key

## üîß DEBUGGING ATTEMPTS MADE

### 1. Server Stability Fixes:
- Added robust JSON error handling
- Added catch-all error handlers
- Fixed server crashes from malformed JSON
- Added extensive logging to webhook endpoint

### 2. Webhook Debugging:
- Added detailed logging to webhook endpoint
- Added GET endpoint for webhook accessibility testing
- Added request logging (method, headers, body)
- Added error handling for webhook processing

### 3. Email System Fixes:
- Migrated from Zoho SMTP to Resend API
- Fixed email template issues
- Added proper error handling
- Tested email sending successfully

### 4. Database Fixes:
- Fixed SQL queries for order lookups
- Added fallback order lookup mechanisms
- Fixed payment ID vs database ID mismatches

### 5. Latest Changes (September 6, 2025):
- **Fixed syntax error**: Removed duplicate `orderResult` declaration that was crashing server
- **Changed order lookup**: Now using `custom_id` from webhook instead of `payment_id`
- **Database analysis**: Confirmed we store PayPal Order IDs in `payment_id` column
- **Webhook data structure**: PayPal sends Payment ID in webhook, but we need Order ID to find order
- **Current approach**: Using `capture.custom_id` (our database order ID) to find orders

### 6. Critical Discovery (September 6, 2025 - 3:38 PM):
- **Webhook is being received**: Server logs show webhook calls are reaching the server
- **Missing custom_id**: PayPal webhook data does not contain `custom_id` field
- **Error**: "‚ùå No custom_id found in webhook data"
- **Root cause**: PayPal is not sending the `custom_id` we set during order creation
- **Added comprehensive debugging**: Full webhook data structure logging to identify where order ID is located

## ‚úÖ ISSUES RESOLVED - ALL WORKING!

### 1. PayPal Order ID Lookup - FIXED! ‚úÖ
**Solution**: Fixed webhook to use proper PayPal Order ID lookup from multiple fields
**Result**: Orders are now found successfully using PayPal Order ID
**Evidence**: Recent orders show `status = completed` and `payment_status = completed`

### 2. Order Status Updates - FIXED! ‚úÖ
**Solution**: Added `status = 'completed'` to webhook update query
**Result**: Orders are now properly updated to "completed" status
**Evidence**: All recent orders show `status = completed`

### 3. Email Notifications - FIXED! ‚úÖ
**Solution**: Fixed critical `ReferenceError: orderId is not defined` that was crashing webhook
**Result**: Confirmation emails are now being sent to customers and admin
**Evidence**: Multiple emails received in inbox from `admin@plwgscreativeapparel.com`

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED - ALL WORKING!
