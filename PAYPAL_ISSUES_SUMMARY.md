# PayPal Issues Summary

## Current Status
- ✅ PayPal payment functionality works
- ✅ All payment options restored (venmo, paylater, card)
- ✅ Syntax errors fixed
- ❌ Extra popup window still occurs
- ❌ CSS font loading errors (PayPal internal)

## Issues Reported
1. **Extra popup window** - Blank popup appears when clicking "Pay with PayPal"
2. **CSS font errors** - PayPal internal styling errors (404 on font files)

## Attempted Fixes
1. Added Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy header to server.js
2. Fixed JavaScript syntax errors
3. Removed duplicate functions
4. Added font fallbacks (didn't help)

## Root Cause Analysis
- The extra popup is likely caused by PayPal SDK configuration or external scripts
- CSS errors are PayPal's internal issues, not fixable from our end
- COOP headers were added but may not be sufficient

## Next Steps Needed
1. Investigate what's actually triggering the extra popup
2. Check if it's related to specific PayPal funding options
3. Look for external scripts that might be causing popups
4. Test with different PayPal SDK configurations

## Files Modified
- `server.js` - Added COOP headers
- `pages/checkout.html` - Fixed syntax errors, restored payment options

## Note
User is frustrated with repeated attempts that disabled payment options. Focus should be on finding the actual popup source without removing functionality.
